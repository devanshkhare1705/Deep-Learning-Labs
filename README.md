# APS360-Labs
Course labs for APS360: Applied Deep Learning at the University of Toronto. This was a core course for my Certificate in Artificial Intelligence (AECERAIEN) during my BASc at UofT.


Lab 1:

1. Performed fundamental NumPy operations.
2. Loaded and manipulated images using Matplotlib.
3. Loaded and mainpulated tensor data in Pytorch.
4. Configured and trained Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) using PyTorch.
5. Evaluated different ANN configuations.


Lab 2:

1. Implemented the training loop for a machine learning model.
2. Understood the distinction between training, validation, and test data.
3. Understood the concepts of overfitting and underfitting.
4. Investigated how different hyperparameters, such as learning rate and batch size, affected the success of training.
5. Compared an ANN (aka Multi-Layer Perceptron) with a CNN.
